|[String Grouper](https://github.com/Bergvca/string_grouper)|`string_grouper` is a library that makes finding groups of similar strings within a single, or multiple, lists of strings easy â€” and fast. `string_grouper` uses **tf-idf** to calculate [cosine similarities](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-cosine-similarity-and-its-application-fd42f585296a) within a single list or between two lists of strings. The full process is described in the blog [Super Fast String Matching in Python](https://bergvca.github.io/2017/10/14/super-fast-string-matching.html).|
