# Question Answering System using BiDAF Model on SQuAD

>Research Work

Implemented a Bidirectional Attention Flow neural network as a baseline on SQuAD, improving Chris Chute's model [implementation](https://github.com/chrischute/squad/blob/master/layers.py), adding word-character inputs as described in the original paper and improving [GauthierDmns' code](https://github.com/GauthierDmn/question_answering).
